# Pokemon Battle Maison Ultimate
My name is **Yuri** and I'm a Computer Scientist in Galicia, Spain. I've started this project in order to improve the capabilities of my Pokemon Team in Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire in the Battle Maison. 

Driven by my love for both programming and Pokemon, I've utilized advanced webscraping techniques in Python 3.10 to gather all the necessary information for my project. Even I had translations for Spanish and English. With this precise and valuable data, I consider that this application can leverage and gain a competitive advantage in the Battle Maison of XY or ORAS.

But my efforts go even further. To present this information in an intuitive and user-friendly manner, I have been developing a Cutting-Edge Frontend Project with Vue. Vue is an up-to-date Frontend Framework whose main principle is reactivity: changes alters the data. In other words, I've crafted an exceptional interface that showcases the full potential of my Pokemon Team.
